Commands used:
docker run -it -d --name dependencies ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching..."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

As our test webpage

The output being:
Searching...
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.20.1</center>
</body>
</html>

An smarter approach would be to use this line directly after creating the container:
docker exec dependencies sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get -y install curl' so we don't have to enter the CLI

An even smarter approach would be to attach it to the beginning of the command when creating the container, like so:
docker run -it --name dependencies ubuntu sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get -y install curl; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching..."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
This way it is not necessary to make it detachable and runs continuously
